## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

{% method -%}
## Install {#install}

The first thing is to get the GitBook API client.

{% sample lang="js" -%}
```bash
$ npm install gitbook-api
```

{% sample lang="go" -%}
```bash
$ go get github.com/GitbookIO/go-gitbook-api
```
{% endmethod %}
