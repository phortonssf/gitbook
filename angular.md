## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

Define a variable `x` equal to 10.

```js
var x =
```

```js
var x = 10;
```

```js
assert(x == 10);
```

```js
// This is context code available everywhere
// The user will be able to call magicFunc in his code
function magicFunc() {
    return 3;
}
```
